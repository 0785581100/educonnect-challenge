# ðŸŽ¯ Approach and Key Decisions - EduConnect Platform

**Architecture Choice**: Selected Laravel 8.x with Sanctum for the backend API due to its robust ecosystem, built-in authentication, and excellent API development capabilities. For the mobile app, chose Expo SDK 53 with TypeScript for rapid cross-platform development and type safety.

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Authentication**: Implemented JWT token-based authentication using Laravel Sanctum with global state management in the mobile app for consistent user experience.
- **Performance**: Developed a cache-first architecture with intelligent 5-minute caching and background refresh to optimize loading times and reduce API calls.
- **User Experience**: Created a consistent purple gradient design system with bottom navigation, smooth loading states, and comprehensive error handling.
- **Data Management**: Built a centralized cache manager using AsyncStorage for offline support and real-time UI updates.

**Advanced Features**: Implemented role-based access control (admin/instructor/student), comprehensive admin panel using Filament, and platform-specific API configurations for Android/iOS compatibility.

**Production Readiness**: Architecture supports scalability with optimized database queries, proper indexing, and deployment configurations for both mobile and backend applications.

The platform successfully demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with focus on user experience, performance, and maintainability.
